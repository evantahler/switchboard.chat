        <p>Switchboard.chat not only facilitates communication in a hub-and-spoke model (where all communication flows from team members to this application), but it also allows you enable "Mesasge Commands" for a subset of your team members.</p>

        <p>Listed below are the Message Commands which are currently active.  Team members can send a message starting with a `/` and the proper word, and switchboard.chat will preform the action stated.</p>

        <p>We will be adding more commands as they are requested.</p>
