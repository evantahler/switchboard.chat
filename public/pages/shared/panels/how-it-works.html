  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>When you sign up for switchboard.chat, you will be creating your team and the first memeber of that team.. you.</p>

    <p>Each team has 1 phone number used for SMS communication.  You can have unlimited members of your team, and unlimited people in your address book whom you are communicating with.</p>

    <p>Registering a team costs ${{ $root.billing.rates.pricePerMonth }}/month.  This covers the cost of your phone number and the fist {{ $root.billing.rates.includedMessagesPerMonth }} SMS messages.  Every additional message after that costs ${{ $root.billing.rates.pricePerMessage }}.</p>

    <p>When you create your team, you will be randomly assigned a phone number within the area code you choose.  This service only works within the United States at this time.</p>
