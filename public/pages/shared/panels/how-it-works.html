  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>When you sign up for switchboard.chat, you will be creating your team and the first memeber of that team...you!</p>

    <p>Each team has a single phone number used for SMS communication.  You can have unlimited members of your team, and unlimited people in your address book with whom you are communicating.</p>

      <p>When you create your team, you will be randomly assigned a phone number within the area code you have chosen.  Please note that this service only works within the United States at this time ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ .</p>

    <p>Registering a team costs <strong>${{ $root.billing.rates.pricePerMonth / 100 }}/month</strong>.  This covers the cost of your phone number and the first {{ $root.billing.rates.includedMessagesPerMonth }} SMS messages.  Every <strong>additional message sent or received will incur a fee of ${{ $root.billing.rates.pricePerMessage / 100 }}</strong>.  You will be billed ${{ $root.billing.rates.pricePerMonth / 100 }} when you first sign up. Going forward, the monthly fee, combined with the fee for additional messages, will then be charged on the first of every month. </p>
