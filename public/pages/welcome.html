<h1>Welcome to switchboard.chat!</h1>

<p>The SMS phone number for your team, <strong>`{{$root.team.name}}`</strong>, is <strong>{{ $root.formatters.phoneNumber($root.team.phoneNumber) }}</strong>.  You can always find this number on the <a href="/#/team">team settings page</a></p>

<p>First, visit <a href="/#/account">your account page</a> and add in your own phone number.  This way, you can configure switchboard.chat to both email and sms you if there are unread team messages.</p>

<p>Next, visit the <a href="/#/messages">messages page</a>.  Here is where you will manage the people in your address book, send, and check SMS messages</p>
